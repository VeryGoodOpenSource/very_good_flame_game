A Very Good Flame game created by Very Good Ventures ðŸ¦„.

Out of the box, Very Good Core includes:

- âœ… Components - Think of them as game objects, or anything that can render in a game.
- âœ… Entity and Behaviors - Entities are what manage the game objects and the behaviors handle the game logic for those objects.
- âœ… Sprite Sheets - Easily access and render sprites on the screen.
- âœ… Audio - Background music and sound effects within the game.
- âœ… VGV Project Architecture - This project contains a similar architecture to other VGV projects (see our [core starter app](very_good_core_link)).
- âœ… 100% Test Coverage â€” Each line is executed at least once by a test.

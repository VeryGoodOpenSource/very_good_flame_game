A Very Good Flame game created by Very Good Ventures 🦄.

Out of the box, Very Good Flame Game includes:

- ✅ Components - Think of them as game objects, or anything that can render in a game.
- ✅ Entity and Behaviors - Entities are what manage the game objects and the behaviors handle the game logic for those objects.
- ✅ Sprite Sheets - Easily access and render sprites on the screen.
- ✅ Audio - Background music and sound effects within the game.
- ✅ VGV Project Architecture - This project contains a similar architecture to other VGV projects (see our [core starter app](very_good_core_link)).
- ✅ 100% Test Coverage — Each line is executed at least once by a test.
